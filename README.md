==============
~~Item Scroller~~ Only-Crafts is a tiny mod for Minecraft 1.16.4+, which adds the functionality of moving items in inventory GUIs
by scrolling the mouse wheel over slots with items in them.
This is basically what NEI does/did (and Mouse Tweaks also seems to do), but separated into this tiny mod,
and probably implemented in a different manner.
For more information about the mod this mods basically is but just has villager trading support removed, see http://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/item-scroller
Note: masa is awesome!
